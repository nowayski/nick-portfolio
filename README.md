This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Purpose

This project was for me to simultaneously learn new skills but also to create a place to display personal
information, projects and blogs.

I set out to create this website using tailwind css and next.js.

For the blogs page, I made use of Next's dynamic routing and static generation so that when i add more blogs
to my website in the future the only required action will be to push the markdown file to my repository.

This website is hosted using vercel services, which provide a clean way of determining environment variables
hence obscuring my private information (emails and passwords).

## Future Plans

I hope I can implement the following in the future:

* Dark mode with a button for switching between the two.
* A more clean projects page layout with a more consolidated design.
